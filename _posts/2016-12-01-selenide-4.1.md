Achievement unlocked!

This day came. We releases Selenide 4.1 that contain only your changes. Made by you. Your pull requests.

# #428 Improve byAttribute method for search via css selectors

Method `byAttribute` (or shorter `by`) got more powerful. 
Before now, you could use it to find elements by attribute value:

```java
$(by("first-name", "john macclane").click();
```

Now you can use it to search element by substring in attribute:

```java
$(by("first-name*", "hn maccl").click();
```

by a starting of attribute:

```java
$(by("first-name*", "joh").click();
```

by an ending of attribute:

```java
$(by("first-name*", "clane").click();
```

and even by a word in attribute:

```java
$(by("first-name*", "john").click();
```

# #419 #425 Added methods `texts(List)` and `exactTexts(List)`

Before now, you could check texts in collection using varargs parameter:

```java
$("#row-1 td").shouldHave(texts("pjotr", "iljich", "chajkovskij")));
```

Now you can also pass list instead of varargs:

```java
List<String> expected = asList("pjotr", "iljich", "chajkovskij");
$("#row-1 td").shouldHave(texts(expected)));
```

Thanks to 

* [Yakov Kramarenko](https://github.com/yashaka) for the [suggestion](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/419), and
* [Pavel Smolensky](https://github.com/pavelsmolensky) for the [pull request](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/425).

# Improve support for gecko (marionette) driver

Now instead of 

```java
  new MarionetteDriver(capabilities);
```

Selenide initializes webdriver like this:

```java
  DesiredCapabilities capabilities = createFirefoxCapabilities(proxy);
  capabilities.setCapability("marionette", true);
  return new FirefoxDriver(capabilities);
```

I still don't understand if (and why) it's better, but we are working on Marionette driver support anyway.

# Upgraded dependencies:
* selenium-java 3.0.1
* htmlunit-driver 2.23.2
* gson 2.8.0
* guava 20.0
* httpcore:4.4.5

<br/>

## News 
 
* Blogs post about Selenide [in Japanese](http://qiita.com/shimashima35/items/a437f0ed080a9ba71b72)
* Presentation about Selenide [in Japanese](http://backpaper0.github.io/ghosts/try-selenide/index.html#1)
* [Selenide demo](https://github.com/backpaper0/selenide-demo) with Redmine and Docker

I cannot read Japanese, but look how beautiful those page objects are!

```java
public class AdminPage extends AbstractPage {

    @FindBy(name = "commit")
    public SelenideElement デフォルト設定をロード;

    @FindBy(css = ".users")
    public SelenideElement ユーザー;
}
```

And more beauty in Japanese:

```java
public void 添付ファイル数は(int size) {
  添付ファイル一覧.shouldHaveSize(size);
}
```

Isn't it nice?

Selenide 4.2 will be released very soon.
