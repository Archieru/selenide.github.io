Good evening!

We released Selenide 4.8. It's mainly a Selenium upgrade.

# Upgraded to selenium 3.6

This version contains some backward incompatible changes, that's why we decided to make a separate release. 

Thanks to [Ostap Oleksyn](https://github.com/ostap-oleksyn) for [pull request 611](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/611). 


By the way, we also upgraded to `guava 23.0` and `org.apache.httpcomponents:httpcore:4.4.7`. 


# Fix an error with soft asserts 
 
Thanks to [Ostap Oleksyn](https://github.com/ostap-oleksyn) for fixing [issue 614](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/614)

That's it. This time the upgrade should be easy.
