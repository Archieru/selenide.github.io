Good day!
The championship is finally finished, and we can get back to our favorite open-source projects. 

Today we released Selenide 4.12.3

Let's look what's inside!

# Added support for JUnit 5

As you know, Selenide has special support for the most popular testing frameworks: JUnit4 and TestNG.
It means special "@Rules" or "Listeners", which can periodically restart a browser, make screenshots etc.

Now we added similar support for JUnit 5 too:

* `BrowserStrategyExtension`
* `ScreenShooterExtension`
* `SoftAssertsExtension`
* `TextReportExtension`

Thanks to [Aliaksandr Rasolka](https://github.com/rosolko) for [PR 757](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/757)

By the way, we have also rewritten [Selenide own tests](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/tree/master/src/test/java) to JUnit5 and AssertJ. 
So you can look for JUnit5 examples there if you need.

# Timeout for downloading files

As you know, Selenide has method `$.download()` for downloading files. It uses the standard setting 
`Configuration.timeout` to avoid too slow/hanging downloads.
 
But some files are expected to download slowly. For example, when generating some heavy reports.
For such cases we added a `download` method with `timeout` parameter:

```java
File hugeReport = $("#huge-report").download(100500);
```
 
See [issue 758](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/758) - thanks to [Yuri Ivanov](https://github.com/YuriIvanov) for [PR 761](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/761)

# Collection reloading on every method call 

This changes caused hot discussions. 

Collection is a list of matched elements returned by method`$$`. It returns ALL matched elements.
Sometimes this list can be long. Sometimes it can make tests slower.

### Before
Before version 4.10.1, Selenide always loaded tho whole collection on every method call.
That's why a trivial **iterating** over big collection (few handreds of elements) could be slow:
```java
$$("span").forEach(item -> item.is(visible));
``` 

### After
From Selenide 4.10.1, we started caching collections. The iterating became faster, but we got new complains. 
Some people store collection to a variable and do expect that it will be reloaded all the time: 

```java
ElementsCollection movieTitles = $$(".film");
assertEquals("Black Panther", movieTitles.get(0).getText());
$(By.name("sort")).selectOption("Release Date");
assertEquals("The Irishman", movieTitles.get(0).getText());
```

In my opinion, this code is _unnatural_: if I expect the collection to be changed, it would be natural to
call method `$$` once again. That's why I didn't want to revert caching for some time. 

But finally "consistency" argument won. Method `$` does reload element on every method call, so `$$` 
should behave the same way.

### Now
So we choosed a compromise: `$$` reloads the collection on every method call 
**except `$$.iterator()` and `$$.listIterator()`**. So the iteration will be fast, and elements will be 
reloaded (almost) always. I don't know if it was the right decision. The new behaviour can
also cause some unexpected effects and pains. We will see.

### $$.snapshot()
By the way, if you want to cache the collection explicitly, we added method `$$.snapshot()`.
It returns a current state of the collection - "snapshot". 
It will not reload collection elements anymore. Iterating and any checks will be faster.
You can you use this method when you know that the elements will not be loaded dynamically.
