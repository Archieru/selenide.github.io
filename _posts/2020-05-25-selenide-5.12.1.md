Good night!

This is a quickfix release [Selenide 5.12.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/97?closed=1) 
with a couple of minor fixes for [Selenide 5.12.0](/2020/05/23/selenide-5.12.0/) 
  

## Fixed _Concurrent modification exception_ during webdriver initialization

See [issue 1170](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1170) and [PR 1171](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1171).

## Fixed merging of "excludeSwitches" settings of different types

It appeared that setting `excludeSwitches` can have either Array or List type:

```java
  chromeOptions.setExperimentalOption("excludeSwitches", new String[]{"enable-automation", "load-extension"});
  chromeOptions.setExperimentalOption("excludeSwitches", asList("enable-automation", "load-extension"));
```

Selenide 5.12.0 crashed if both of types were used. Now we fixed it.  

See [issue 1169](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1169) and [PR 1174](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1174).
