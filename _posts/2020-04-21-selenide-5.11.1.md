Good evening!

It seems that [Selenide 5.11.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/94?closed=1) still broke too many rules, 
and we decided to slow down the horses.

If you are affected, you can upgrade to [Selenide 5.11.1](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/96?closed=1).


## SLF4J

Some folks didn't like the fact that Selenide 5.11.0 requires a valid slf4j dependency. Folks don't want to 
bother with slf4j. Folks don't want to read our logs. :)

It was unexpected for us, but well, we found a compromise.  

Now Selenide doesn't require slf4j always, but only when it's needed for sure. Namely, when you use 
[`TextReport` feature](/2016/09/26/selenide-3.10/). 


## because we can!

In Selenide 5.11.0 we introduced one small issue. Namely, 

* `$("blah").shouldNot(exist)` - passes (it's ok)
* `$("blah").shouldNot(exist.because("we can"))` - fails (it's not ok)

Word `because` happened to be incompatible with negation. Now we fixed it, and both lines are passing.  

See [issue 1130](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1130) and [1131](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1131). 

## Dropped 16 megabytes

It appears that Selenide had one huge 16 megabyte sized file `checker.jar` among its dependencies.  
Now we removed it. 

Thanks to [Yuriy Artamonov](https://github.com/jreznot) for [PR 1128](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1128).
