Good evening!

Now we are publishing press release of Selenide 5.2.0 which was released 19.02.2019.

Let's quickly read what was changed there, and move on to the next versions.

<br/>

# Added aliases for Kotlin

Since symbols `$` and `$$` cannot be used as method name in Kotlin, using Selenide in Kotlin initially was not as pleasant as in Java.
[Here](https://github.com/selenide-examples/kotlin/blob/master/src/test/kotlin/GoogleTest.kt) you can see some examples of how it could be solved. 

After long discussions and researches, we decided to add simple aliases for Selenide methods `$` and `$$`: `element` and `elements`.
It's a little bit longer than `$`, but the result is human-readable:
* `element(".header").shouldNot(exist)` 
* `elements(".header").shouldHave(size(3))` 
 
See [issue 865](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/865).

Thanks to [Jacek Kromski](https://github.com/jkromski) for [PR 870](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/870)!

# Added check for selected text

Now you can check that an element has expected _selected text_:
```java
  $("textarea").shouldHave(selectedText("oo ba"));
  $("textarea").shouldHave(text("foo bar"));
```

See [issue 766](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/766).

# Improved support for `chromeoptions.args` and `chromeoptions.prefs` system properties

Actually, I am not sure if it's a useful feature. Probably it's easier to just implement `WebDriverProvider`.
But still, we improved it.  

Thanks to [Alexei Vinogradov](https://github.com/vinogradoff) for [PR 883](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/883).

# Remove an old hack for Chrome maximization

Older versions of Chrome driver could not maximize the browser window. That's why Selenide had a special hack to maximize Chrome.
Now it's not needed anymore, and we removed the hack.

See [issue 838](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/838) and [PR 901](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/901).
