Good night, Seleniders!

We recently got a chance to merge a lot of pull requests and released Selenide 4.10  

So, what's new there?

**What you get when update to Selenide 4.10**?

# We added method `$.scrollIntoView()`

You can use it to scroll browser to the right place.
For example, it can be useful to overcome issues of some browser which cannot click an element that is outside of visible window area.

So, method `$.scrollIntoView()` says browser to scroll the page so that the element was in a visible area.

Method can have either boolean parameter:

```java
$("#my-button").scrollIntoView(true);  // the top of the element will be aligned to the top
$("#my-button").scrollIntoView(false); // the bottom of the element will be aligned to the bottom
```

or more advanced String parameter:

```java
$("#my-button").scrollIntoView("{block: \"end\"}");
$("#my-button").scrollIntoView("{behavior: \"instant\", block: \"end\", inline: \"nearest\"}");
```

Read javadoc for the details.

# Now tou can run _headless_ browsers on Selenium Grid

If you run tests on Selenium Grid, you can now open browsers in _headless_ mode.
You need only couple of lines to achieve that:

```java
Configuration.remote = "http://selenium-grid-host:port/wd/hub";
Configuration.headless = true;
```

See [issue 660](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/660)

Thanks to [Boris Osipov](https://github.com/BorisOsipov) for [pull request 661](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/661).

# Now you can set custom capabilities for Chrome and Firefox

You can set custom capabilities in `Configuration`, and Selenide will use them when opening a browser:

```java
Configuration.browserCapabilities = new DesiredCapabilities();
Configuration.browserCapabilities.setCapability(SOME_CAP, "SOME_VALUE_FROM_CONFIGURATION");
```

See [issue 556](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/556)

# We optimized performance of `$$` iteration

Some of Seleniders found that such collection iteration can be slow:
           
```java
$$("span").forEach(item -> item.is(visible));
```

Because Selenide reloads all collection elements on every step. 
See [issue 641](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/641)

We fixed that. Now the loop should be much faster. 
Thanks to [Artem Savosik](https://github.com/CaBocuk) for [pull request 653](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/653).

# We added "User-Agent" header when downloading a file

As you probably know, Selenide downloads files by issuing a separate http request, copying all cookies from browser to it.
Sometimes it's not enough, because application also checks `User-Agent` in addition to session cookie. And method `$().download()` didn't work in this case. 

See [issue 639](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/639)

Now Selenide also copies `User-Agent` header from browser to http request for downloading file. Method `$().download()` should work.

Thanks to [Aleksandr Rasolka](https://github.com/rosolko) for [pull request 657](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/657).

# Now methods `byText` and `withText` understand unbreakable spaces

Imagine that you have such an element on a page:

```html
<span>Hello&nbsp;world</span>
```

By now, command `$(byText("Hello world"))` or `$(withText("Hello world"))` could not find it. Now it can.

We improved methods `byText` and `withText` to understand non-breakable spaces, or characters `&nbsp` or `\u00A0`.
Now these characters are treated as usual spaces. 

See [issue 597](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/597)

# Upgraded to phantomjsdriver 1.4.4

Which in turn was upgraded to selenium-java 3.8.1 (and doesn't have any other changes).  

<br>

# Upgraded to htmlunit 2.29 and guava:23.6-jre

... just in case
