Buchahos!

Recently we got a lot of pull requests with lot of usefull changes. This is the power of open source!

We have merged all those changes and released [Selenide 5.7.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/89?closed=1).


## Added setting `Configuration.downloadsFolder`

Before now, Selenide downloaded files to folder `build/reports` - the same folder which contains generated test reports.    
But sometimes people want to have reports and screenshots in separate folders.  
For those people we added a dedicated setting `Configuration.downloadsFolder` - now Selenide will download files there.

By default it's `build/downloads`.

See [issue 1025](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1025).  
Thanks to [Dmytro Stekanov](https://github.com/dstekanov) for [PR 1041](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1041).

### Download files to `Configuration.downloadsFolder` instead of `~/Downloads`

We had one more nuance when downloading files via proxy (`Configuration.fileDownload=PROXY`).    
Selenide downloads files to its own folder `build/reports` (now `build/downloads`), but browser also downloads the same 
 files to folder `~/Downloads` (or what is the system default). It takes disk space, and nobody cleans up those files after test run. 

Now Selenide configures webdriver to download files to folder `build/downloads`.
1. But only for Chrome and Firefox by now.
2. And only in case of Selenide opens webdriver by itself. 

See [issue 1057](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1057).
Thanks to [Dmitri Korobtsov](https://github.com/dkorobtsov) for code review of [PR 1058](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1058).

### Added method for switching between windows with custom timeout

As you know, Selenide has methods for switching between tabs/windows:

```java
switchTo().window(3);
```

This method is smart enough to wait until window is loaded. But it was impossible to set a timeout: the default 4 seconds was used here.  

Now we added a overloaded method with timeout parameter:

```java
switchTo().window(3,  Duration.ofSeconds(42));
switchTo().window(3,  Duration.ofMillis(16000));
```

See [issue 399](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/399).  
Thanks to [Dmytro Stekanov](https://github.com/dstekanov) for [PR 1054](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1054).

### Added logging of "readonly" attribute

See [issue 990](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/990).  
Thanks to [Dmytro Stekanov](https://github.com/dstekanov) for [PR 1042](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1042).

### Fixed IndexOutOfBoundsException 

... when searching first/last element of an empty collection

See [issue 991](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/991).  
Thanks to [Dmytro Stekanov](https://github.com/dstekanov) for [PR 1043](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1043).
 
<br/> 

### And several screenshot improvements
#### 1. Returned the lost screenshots in `Screenshots.getLastScreenshot()`

See [issue 814](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/814) and [issue 880](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/880).    
Thanks to [Petro Ovcharenko](https://github.com/petroOv-PDFfiller) for [PR 1052](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1052).

#### 2. Fixed link to screenshots in Jenkins
Now Selenide can read environment variable `BUILD_URL`, and you don't need to set system variable `BUILD_URL` in your build scripts.  
    
Thanks to [GongYi](https://github.com/GongYi) for [PR 1049](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1049).

#### 3. Fixed paths to s reenshots in multi-module Maven builds
Thanks to [GongYi](https://github.com/GongYi) for [PR 1049](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1049).
