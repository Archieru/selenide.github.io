Good night!

With a big lag and regret, we are publishing press release of Selenide 5.1.1 
Let's quickly read what was changed there, and move on to the next versions. 


# Selenide allows clicking on transparent elements
Until now, Selenide didn't allow clicking elements with `opacity: 0`.
It seemed reasonable because real user cannot click element which he cannot see.
But we found that sometimes it's useful - e.g. when there is a file upload field behind the transparent element. 

Now we don't forbid it. :)

See [issue 201](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/201)

Thanks to [Alexei Vinogradov](https://github.com/vinogradoff) for [PR 874](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/874) 
and [Alexei Barantsev](https://github.com/barancev) for patient explanations of how Selenium really works. :)

# Fixed NPE when custom webdriver is run without proxy, but user asks for proxy

Now instead of `NullPointerException` you will see human-readable 
```java
IllegalStateException: config.proxyEnabled == true but proxy server is not started.
```

# Now you can switch between two webdrivers as many times as you wish

It worked correctly in Selenide 4.x and earlier, bug was broken in Selenide 5.0.0. Now we fixed it. 

See [issue 867](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/867) and [PR 890](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/890)

# Selenide generates unique folder for every downloaded file

Until now, Selenide used to download all files to folder `build/reports/tests` with their original names.
It could cause a problem when two parallel tests tried to download files with the same name.

Now Selenide will download every while to a unique folder `build/reports/UUID` 
(but still with its original name, because sometimes the file name is important). 

See [issue 892](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/892) and [PR 893](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/893).
