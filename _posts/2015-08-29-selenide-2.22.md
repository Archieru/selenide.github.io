Good saturday!

Recently we released Selenide 2.21 and 2.22. They contain few but important changes. 

## Upgrade to Java 7

Starting from version 2.21, Selenide only works on Java 7 and higher.

If you used Java 6, it's time to upgrade.

## Upgrade to Selenium 2.47.1

* It requires Java 7.
* It supports native events only for FireFox 31. For later FireFox versions only synthetic events are supported.
* It adds experimental support for the new browser "Microsoft Edge".

[All changes in Selenium 2.47.1](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/dotnet/CHANGELOG) 

## Fixed problem with unclosed browsers 

In Selenide 2.20 we reworked mechanism of closing browser. But it caused a defect: sometimes browser left open.
Now this problem is fixed.

# Thank you for your help!

Thanks for all who voted for my proposal. 
It was accepted to the [SeleniumConf 2015](http://year-2015.seleniumconf.org/) conference. 
I am going 8.09 to Portland to present Selenide at the world's biggest Selenium conference.


<br/>

And what's up to you?
