Buenos Marchos!

In Selenide, we strive to cure flaky tests all the time.   

Today we released [Selenide 5.9.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/92?closed=1) with one feature that can help to overcome some of your flaky tests.  

## We added a filter for downloading files: `$.download(FileFilter)`

### Problem
When downloading files _via proxy_, Selenide can sometimes download a wrong file.    
This is how it works: Selenide clicks the "download" button and intercepts all responses from server to browser.

Exactly at this moment there could happen some unrelated requests between browser and server.  
Say, chrome decides to check for updates at this moment. Or your AUT sends request to google analytics. Or just some background requests.   
This creates fertile ground for emergence of _flaky tests_ which work on your machine but sometimes fail on jenkins. 

### Solution
To avoid such collisions, you can now explicitly specify which file you expect.
Out of the box, there are filters by file name or extension. And you can create your own
 [`FileFilter`](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/src/main/java/com/codeborne/selenide/files/FileFilter.java) implementations with
 any filters you need.  
Given such a filter, Selenide will select the right response matching your criteria.  

See examples [in tests](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/statics/src/test/java/integration/FileDownloadViaProxyTest.java):

```java
File f1 = $("#downloadMe").download(withName("hello_world.txt"));
File f2 = $("#downloadMe").download(withNameMatching("hello_.\\w+\\.txt"));
File f3 = $("#downloadMe").download(timeout, withExtension("txt"));
```

## News

* A funny [dialog](https://twitter.com/titusfortner/status/1234862932036608001) in Twitter: 
contributor of Selenium and Watir projects Titus Fortner admitted that he watched [my presentation about Selenide on SeleniumConf](/2015/09/23/selenide-on-seleniumconf/),
 and even stole some ideas for Watir. And I admitted that some of Selenide ideas were initially stolen from Watir. :)

* A good article [Modern Best Practices for Testing in Java](https://phauer.com/2019/modern-best-practices-testing-java/). A plenty of right ideas.  
* A post [Selenide Test Automation: Using Selenoid in the Docker Container](https://hackernoon.com/selenide-in-test-automation-through-selenoid-in-the-docker-container-ttw320f)
* A post [Parametrized UI testing with Selenide and Junit 5](https://medium.com/@neznajuskas/parametrized-ui-testing-with-selenide-and-junit-5-9aca75a8d62f)
* Some base project [qa-automation-base](https://github.com/romsper/qa-automation-base/tree/kotlin-junit5-appium) which has mixed Kotlin + Selenide/Appium + JUnit 5 + Allure + Allure EE + TestRail.
