We released Selenide 5.3.0. What's new?

<br/>

# #968 Execute custom commands

You will like this feature!

I believe your code is fill of custom methods for operating web elements. You use some tricky double click, 
select some non-standard radio button on ReactJS, pick a date from hipster datepicker and upload a file from hidden input.

Now we added a convenient way to execute such commands in one line. You just need to call method `$.execute`:

```java
    var turnCalendar = new Command<SelenideElement>() {...};
    var pickDate = new Command<SelenideElement>() {...};

    $("hiddenFileInput").execute(turnCalendar).execute(pickDate("03.09");
``` 

Thanks to [Aleksandr Rasolka](https://github.com/rosolko) for [pull request 968](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/968).

# #970 Improved error message for `shouldHave(attribute("href", ..."))`

Folks reported a strange problem: `href` is the same, but test fails:

```java
Element should have attribute href="/files/hello_world.txt" {by text: Download me}
Element: '<a href="/files/hello_world.txt">Download me</a>'
```

The problem is with one nuance in Selenium: method `WebElement.getAttribute("href")` returns absolute URL, even if `href` contains a relative URL.<br/>

Actually we haven't fixed this nuance, but improved the error message. Now it shows the actual value of the attribute:

```java
Actual value: href="http://my-test-env.com:9999/files/hello_world.txt"
```

<br/>

# #469 Improved error messages for OR checks

Probably you know that Selenide allows you to check one of multiple conditions (OR operand). 
It's useful when you need to check if first OR second condition is matched (or both). 

```java
    
    $("input#agree").shouldBe(or("checked", 
      attribute("checked", "true"), 
      attribute("checked", "on")
    ));

```

<br/>

The problem was: when such a test failed, it reported an invalid error message. It included only the first condition:

```java

Element should have attribute 'attribute checked' {input#agree}"

```

<br/>

We have fixed it. Now it reports all conditions from OR block:

```java

Element should be checked: attribute 'true' or attribute 'on' {input#agree}

```
