Good evening!

We released Selenide 3.3 with support for collections.

## Ajax support for collections

Now collection methods `$$` can wait until collection elements get loaded.
It can be useful for collections that are loaded asynchronously with Ajax.

See. [issue #277](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/277)

## Added separate timeout for collections

We added two configuration parameters:

  * `collectionsTimeout` (default value 6 seconds)
  * `collectionsPollingInterval` (default value 0.2 seconds)

Typically collections are loaded longer than single elements (they contain more than one element).
That's why they need longer timeout.

## Upgraded to selenium-java 2.51.0

See [selenium 2.51.0 changelog]({{site.SELENIUM_CHANGELOG}}).
