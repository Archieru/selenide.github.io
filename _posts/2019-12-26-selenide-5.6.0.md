Good morning!

In the end of the year, we released [Selenide 5.6.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/87?closed=1) with one significant change.

We replaced (outdated) `BrowserMobProxy` by its fork `BrowserUpProxy` (current version 2.0.1).

See [issue 1019](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1019).  
Thanks to [Aliaksandr Rasolka](https://github.com/rosolko) for [PR 1020](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1020).  

## What good is there is `BrowserUpProxy`?

It
* supports Brotli Compression (in addition to gzip)
* supports HTTP/2
* based on actively maintained fork [LittleProxy](https://github.com/mrog/LittleProxy)
* uses a better [HAR reader](https://github.com/sdstoehr/har-reader)
* can filter HAR entries
* supports versioned headers for JSON like `Content-Type=application/something-v1+json`
* has built-in asserts for network and pages

Here is the [full changelog](https://github.com/browserup/browserup-proxy/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) of `BrowserUpProxy` (compared to BrowserMobProxy).

## How to upgrade?

In most cases, you don't need to change anything. Everything just work as before.  
Some changes are required only in 2 cases:  

#### 1. If you declared BMP dependency explicitly, you need to replace

```java
net.lightbody.bmp:browsermob-core:2.1.5
```

by 

```java
com.browserup:browserup-proxy-core:2.0.1
```

#### 2. If you implemented `RequestFilter` or `ResponseFilter`,

you need to replace import

```java
import net.lightbody.bmp.*;
```

by  

```java
import com.browserup.bup.*;
```

That's it. Nothing more.
