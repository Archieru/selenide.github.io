Good night!

We have released [Selenide 5.11.0](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/milestone/94?closed=1).  
This is the second quarantine release of Selenide in which we made a couple of breaking changes.  
 

## Changed the behaviour of `shouldNot*` methods for unexisting elements

Just look at the table below to understand what changed.  
Assuming element `h1` **does not exist** on a page:

Check                                                                              | Selenide 5.10- | Selenide 5.11+
--------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------
`h1.shouldNot(exist)`                                                   | ok                      | ok
`h1.shouldNotBe(visible)`                                           | ok                      | ok
`h1.shouldBe(hidden)`                                                | ok                      | ok
`h1.shouldNotHave(text("foo"))`                               | ok                      | FAIL
`h1.shouldNotHave(attribute("bar"))`                       | ok                      | FAIL
`h1.find("h2").shouldNot(exist)`                                 | ok                      | ok
`h1.find("h2").shouldNotHave(text("foo"))`             | ok                      | FAIL
--------------------------------------------------|----------------|----------------

### Previous logic
A long time ago it was decided in Selenide: the check `h1.shouldNotHave(text("foo"))` should not fail. If the element `<h1>` 
does not exist, then it doesn't have text "foo". So, the condition "should not have text" is true. 

Additionally, it seemed to be reasonable because the check `h1.shouldNotHave(text("foo"))` is the opposite to 
`h1.shouldHave(text("foo"))` which fails for an unexisting element.  

### New logic

But we realized that there was a problem with the previous approach: it allowed to make a mistake too easily. 
Namely, you could accidentally write a wrong locator, thus making a false-positive test. Test that was green, but didn't check anything.

Now both `h1.shouldHave(text("foo"))` and `h1.shouldNotHave(text("foo"))` fail if `<h1>` is not found. 

See [issue 368](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/368) and [PR 1116](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1116).


## Now Selenide fails if SLF4J is not configured

If you get such an error:

```java
java.lang.IllegalStateException: SLF4J is not configured. You will not see any Selenide logs. 
  Please add slf4j-simple.jar, slf4j-log4j12.jar or logback-classic.jar to your classpath. 
  See https://github.com/selenide/selenide/wiki/slf4j
```

don't be afraid: just do what it says. It's easy. 

#### What problem we tried to solve?
The problem is: if you don't have any SLF4J implementations in your project, you could miss some important Selenide 
logs, including "text report". Now you are forced to include some of SLF4J implementations. 

See [issue 1114](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1114) and [PR 1115](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1115).


## Added method for _partially_ checking the attribute value 

Until now, Selenide had 2 methods for checking attributes: 
1. presence of attribute, and
2. exact value of attribute:

```java
  $("#domain-container").shouldHave(attribute("class"));
  $("#domain-container").shouldHave(attribute("class", "container"));
``` 

Now we added method `attributeMatching` for _partially_ checking attribute value.  
See examples [in tests](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/blob/master/src/test/java/integration/AttributeTest.java):

```java
@Test
void canVerifyAttributeMatching() {
  $("#domain-container").shouldHave(attributeMatching("class", "contain.*"));  // class="container"
  $("#domain-container").shouldHave(attributeMatching("class", ".*tainer"));
  $("#domain-container").shouldHave(attributeMatching("class", ".+tain.+"));
}
```

See [issue 996](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/996).  
Thanks to [Dmytro Stekanov](https://github.com/dstekanov) for [PR 1100](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1100).

## Added method for getting the last screenshot

We added 2 new methods:
* `Screenshots.getLastThreadScreenshot()` - returns the last screenshot taken in current thread
* `Screenshots.getThreadScreenshots()` - returns all screenshots taken in current thread

Most of the users **do not need** those methods: Selenide adds screenshot details to error message anyway.    
But those methods can be useful for those who write their own frameworks on top of Selenide or integrate Selenide 
with frameworks like Allure.

See [issue 1029](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1029).  
Thanks to [Dmytro Stekanov](https://github.com/dstekanov) for [PR 1125](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1125).

## Added annotation `@CheckReturnValue` to most of Selenide methods

It allows IDE (at least Intellij IDEA) to better analyze your tests and show warnings if you called some Selenide 
method, but forgot to check results:

</center>

Thanks to [Yuriy Artamonov](https://github.com/jreznot) for [PR 1106](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1106).

## Added missing method `Selectors.byTagName()`

Just for consistency with `By` methods. 

Thanks to [Yuriy Artamonov](https://github.com/jreznot) for [PR 1104](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1104).

## Fixed screenshot URL
 
... in case when project is run in Jenkins, and the project path contains spaces. 

See [issue 1072](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1072).  
Thanks to [Dmytro Stekanov](https://github.com/dstekanov) for [PR 1098](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1098).

## Disabled annoying warnings about Chrome extensions

Some folks saw those annoying warnings in Chrome:

<center>
  <img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/2020/04/chrome-warning.png" width="300"/>
</center>

Now we disabled them with this setting:

```java
options.setExperimentalOption("excludeSwitches", new String[]{"enable-automation", "load-extension"});
```  

Please let us know if it causes some problems in your projects.

See [issue 1119](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1119) and [PR 1120](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1120).

## Now you can set `selectorMode` and `assertionMode` via system properties 

... Just for consistency with other Selenide settings.

See [commit 231597eb6229e](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/commit/231597eb6229e).  


## Method `$.getWrappedElement()` doesn't wait anymore 

I guess most of you didn't even know about this method.  
A long time ago, it was added to give access to the original Selenium `WebElement` without any Selenide magic (just in case, if somebody should need it).  
But [Iakiv Kramarenko](https://github.com/yashaka) noticed that it still applies Selenide magic: method `$.getWrappedElement()` waited for presence of the `WebElement`.   

Not it doesn't wait anymore. If the element doesn't exist - you will get `org.openqa.selenium.NoSuchElementException`.  
And yes, you can also get the legendary `StaleElementReferenceException`.   
 
See [issue 1015](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/issues/1015) and [PR 1124](https://github.com/selenide/selenide/pull/1124).

## Statistics

And here is my favorite part: latest Selenide downloads statistics. We hit the line 130 thousands per months!

  <img src="{{ BASE_PATH }}/images/2020/04/selenide.downloads.png" width="800"/>
</center>

and 23 thousands of unique IPs:

Life is good!
