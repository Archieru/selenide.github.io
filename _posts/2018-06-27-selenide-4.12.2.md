We released Selenide 4.12.2

Let's see what was changed there.

<br>

# We added method `because` for collections 

As you know, Selenide has method `because` allowing test author to clarify why he expects this behaviour:

```java
  $("#login").shouldBe(visible.because("After 3 wrong answers user should be logged out"));
```

Now we also have method `because` for collections:

```java
  $$(".error").shouldHave(size(3).because("A separate error message per wrong answer"));
```

See [issue 440](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/440) - thanks to [Mikhail Sidelnikov](https://github.com/sidelnikovmike) for [PR 749](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/749)

# Selenide will not try to open a browser

... if setting `Configuration.reopenBrowserOnFail` is `false`. 

Don't be afraid, nothing will change for most of you. This setting is `true` by default.
 
This setting was initially created for those who want to open/close browser entirely be themselves.  

See [issue 695](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/issues/695) and [PR 754](https://github.com/codeborne/selenide/pull/754)
